# About

This Project is a part of the Learn React series from [The odin project](https://theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/memory-card)

## Structure

the src folder holds three directories. 'components', 'helper-functions' and 'styles'. Components is further divided into distinct directories that house specific component files relating to one another. The styles and helper functions folder is structured the same as the components folder but houses css files and helper js files for their respective namesake components.

## Main Objective

1. Build an web based game application that presents players with multiple images
2. The images should get shuffled every time an image is selected
3. Players CAN NOT click on the same image y=twice, doing so results to game over for the player
4. Player score is calculated based on their plays of the game

## Added Feature

1. Level: Players elevate to a new level upon clicking all available images
