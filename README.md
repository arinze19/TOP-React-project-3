# About 

This Project is a part of the Learn React series from [The odin project](https://theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/memory-card)

## Structure

the src folder holds three directories. 'components', 'helper-functions' and 'styles'. Components is further divided into distinct directories that house specific component files relating to one another. The styles and helper functions folder is structured the same as the components folder but houses css files and helper js files for their respective namesake components.
